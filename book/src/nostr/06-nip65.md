## NIP-65

Either the [Event Builder](https://docs.rs/nostr/latest/nostr/event/builder/struct.EventBuilder.html) struct and associated `relay_list()` function, or, the [Tag](https://docs.rs/nostr/latest/nostr/event/tag/struct.Tag.html) struct and associated `relay_metadata()` function, can be used to construct NIP-65 compliant events (`kind:10002`), which are designed to advertise user's preferred relays from which content can be retrieved and/or published.

### Relay List Metadata (NIP-65)

The simpleist way to create relay metadata events is via the `relay_list()` method and `EventBuilder` class. To do this we pass the method a dictionary containing the relay URL (key) and READ/WRITE (value), which is set using the `RelayMetadata` class.

Note that the where no read or write value is specified (e.g. `None`), these should be handled as both read and write by clients (as indicated in the NIP-65 specification).

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/nip65.py:relay-metadata-simple}}
```

As an alternative approach, the `Tag` class and `relay_metadata()` method can be used to create individual tag objects for inclusion in a purpose built `kind:10002` event. 

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/nip65.py:relay-metadata-custom}}
