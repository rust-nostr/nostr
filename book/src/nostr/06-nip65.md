## NIP-65

The [Tag](https://docs.rs/nostr/latest/nostr/event/tag/struct.Tag.html) struct, in conjunction with the `relay_metadata()` function, can be used to construct NIP-65 compliant events (`kind:10002`) designed to advertise user's preferred relays from which content can be retrived and/or published.

The `Tag` class is instantiated and the `relay_metadata()` method is user to create tags for inclusion in the `kind:10002` event. The details of the tags are set as URL for the relay and, the READ/WRITE value is set using the `RelayMetadata` class. 

Note that the where no read or write value is specified (e.g. `None`), these should be handled as both read and write by clients (as indicated in the NIP-65 specification).
