# Client Message

One of the biggest strengths of the Nostr network is the almost limitless possibilities for interoperable user-facing applications. In protocol terminology these applications are often referred to as Clients. Where relays provide a data housing mechanism the clients get that data in front of users in myriad of wild and wonderful ways. Clients use WebSockets as a means to connect to relays and pass relevant data back and forth around the network. In accordance with the protocol base specification ([NIP-01](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md#from-client-to-relay-sending-events-and-creating-subscriptions)) there are 3 main types of messages which clients construct and pass to relays as JSON arrays. This section is concerned with the construction of these message objects using the [Client Message Module](https://docs.rs/nostr/latest/nostr/message/client/index.html). 

For a more detailed explanation regarding the rules and handling of client message objects please refer to the Nostr protocol documentation linked above.

The `ClientMessage` class easily handles the construction of the 3 main message types `EVENT`, `REQ`, and `CLOSE`. In the examples below we can utilize the relevant class methods `event()`, `req()` and `close()`, respectively, to create the client message objects.

Once we have the `ClientMessage` objects we can use the `as_enum()` or `as_json()` methods to present their content. Note that when using `as_enum()` we unlock some additional methods associated with the `ClientMessageEnum` class. These allow for logical tests to be performed to establish the type of message object being assessed (for example, `is_req()` will return a bool result assessing if the object represents an `REQ` message type).  

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/messages/client.py:event-message}}
```

Note that when constructing a `REQ` we want to pass through a `Filter` object which will allow the relay to return data meeting a given set of criteria. Please jump to the [Filter](05_01_01-filter.md) section for more details on how to construct these objects. 

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/messages/client.py:req-message}}
```

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/messages/client.py:close-message}}
```

When presented with a client message object as either a JSON or an instance of the `ClientMessageEnum` class we can parse these data using the `from_json()` or `from_enum()` methods, respectively.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/messages/client.py:parse-message}}
```

## Authorization and Count Messages

As an extension of the client messaging section of the protocol [NIP-42](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/42.md) and [NIP-45](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/45.md) introduce two new messaging types `AUTH` and `COUNT`.

The `AUTH` type is designed to facilitate a method by which clients can authenticate with a given relay. Whereas the `COUNT` type offers a method for clients can request simple counts of events from relays. These are constructed in much the same way as the earlier message examples, by using the `ClientMessage` class in conjunction with the relevant methods `auth()` and `count()`. As before the `as_enum()` method can be used to unlock logical test methods (e.g., `is_auth()`) associated with these message objects.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/messages/client.py:auth-message}}
```

Note that `COUNT` is effectively a specific type of `REQ` message therefore it utilizes the `Filter` object in constructing the criteria which should be used by the relay to return the count value.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/messages/client.py:count-message}}
```

Finally, the `ClientMessageEnum` class also opens up three additional message types `NEG_OPEN()`, `NEG_CLOSE()` and `NEG_MSG()`. These do not form part of the standard protocol specification but do have specific uses when it comes to providing methods by which error messaging can be handled by clients. To construct these we need to first create them as instance of the `ClientMessageEnum` class and then pass these into a `ClientMessage` object using the `from_enum()` method.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/messages/client.py:neg-open}}
```

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/messages/client.py:neg-close}}
```

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/messages/client.py:neg-msg}}
```
