# Timestamp

As a part of the Nostr protocol, events include a `created_at` field which contains the UNIX timestamp (in seconds) when the event was created. Note that this field can be useful in conjunction with the `since` and `until` properties of filters (see [Filters section](05_01_01-filters.md)) to help clients surface recent/relevant content.

The [Timestamp](https://docs.rs/nostr/latest/nostr/types/time/struct.Timestamp.html) struct is responsible for handling the creation and/or parsing of timestamp objects. This section also covers the `custom_created_at()` method from the `EventBuilder` struct and the `expiration` tag used in functions like `gift_wrap()`.

The `Timestamp` class is used to instantiate a timestamp object and the `now()` method can be used to populate this with the the current UNIX timestamp. The `to_human_datetime()` and `as_secs()` methods can be used to present the timestamp data as a human readable string or, UNIX integer timestamp in seconds, respectively.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/timestamps.py:timestamp-now}}
```

To parse timestamps from integer values the `from_secs()` method can be used. 

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/timestamps.py:timestamp-parse}}
```

## Created_at and Expiration

When building `Event` objects it is possible to utilize the `custom_created_at()` method in conjunction with an instance of the `Timestamp` class to manually set the created_at field for events. When parsing events, the `create_at()` method is used to extract this timestamp information.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/timestamps.py:timestamp-created}}
```

To create expiration tags for inclusion within events the `Tag` class is used along with the `expiration()` method.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/timestamps.py:timestamp-tag}}
```

This example shows how the expiration tag can be set directly during the calling of the `gift_wrap()` function. 

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/timestamps.py:timestamp-expiration}}
```
