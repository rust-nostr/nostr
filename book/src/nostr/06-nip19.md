## NIP-19

Bech-32 encoding is utilized for the primary purpose of transportability between users/client/applications. 
In addition to bech-32 encoding of the data a series of prefixes are also used to help easily differentiate between different data objects. 
`npub`/`nsec` for public and private keys, respectively and `note` for note ids. 

Extra metadata may be included when communicating between applications to make cross compatibility more streamlined. 
These follow a type-length-value structure and have the following possible prefixes: `nprofile`, `nevent`, `nrelay` and `naddr`. 

The [nip19 module](https://docs.rs/nostr/latest/nostr/nips/nip19/index.html) and associated `Nip19Event` and `Nip19Profile` structs can be used to handle construction and interpretation of these data.

For most of these examples you will see that the `to_bech32()` and `from_bech32()` methods generally facilitate encoding or decoding objects per the NIP-19 standard.

Public and Private (or secret) keys in `npub` and `nsec` formats.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/nip19.py:nip19-npub}}
```

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/nip19.py:nip19-nsec}}
```

Simple note presented in NIP-19 format.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/nip19.py:nip19-note}}
```

Using the `Nip19Profile` class to create a shareable `nprofile` that includes relay data to help other applications to locate the profile data.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/nip19.py:nip19-nprofile-encode}}
```

Using the `Nip19` class to decode the previously shared profile data. This class helps generalize the decoding process for all NIP-19 objects.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/nip19.py:nip19-nprofile-decode}}
```

Using the `Nip19Event` class to create a shareable `nevent` that includes author and relay data. This is followed by decoding the event object.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/nip19.py:nip19-nevent-encode}}
```

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/nip19.py:nip19-nevent-decode}}
```

Using the `Coordinate` class to generate the coordinates for a replaceable event (in this case Metadata). This is followed by decoding the object.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/nip19.py:nip19-naddr-encode}}
```

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../snippets/nostr/python/src/nip19.py:nip19-naddr-decode}}
```
