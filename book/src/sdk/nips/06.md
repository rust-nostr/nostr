## NIP-06: Basic key derivation from mnemonic seed phrase

In accordance with the [BIP-32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) and [BIP-39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) we can derive Nostr keys using seed phrases as a source of entropy.

The default functionality is to generate a single key-pair at the derivation path `0`. 
However, it is also possible to perform more advanced derivations by incrementing the `account`, 
enabling the generation of many sets of keys from a single mnemonic seed phrase.

Using the `from_mnemonic()` method in conjunction with the `Keys` class to derived a basic set of Nostr keys from a 24 word seed phrase.

Note that this example uses the `Mnemonic` class from the [python-mnemonic](https://github.com/trezor/python-mnemonic) package (the reference implementation of BIP-39) to randomly generate example seed phrases.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../../snippets/python/src/nip06.py:keys-from-seed24}}
```

As well as deriving basic keys from a 24 word seed we can also use seed phrases of other lengths such as 18 words or, as in this example, 12 words.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../../snippets/python/src/nip06.py:keys-from-seed12}}
```

Advanced key derivation functionality (for accounts) can be accessed by the `from_mnemonic()` method. 
To do this we use the `account` argument which accepts an integer to specify the derivation path.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../../snippets/python/src/nip06.py:keys-from-seed-accounts}}
```

This final example utilizes the same seed as for the previous example, but also includes a `passphrase`. 
It illustrates the effect of inclusion of a passphrase on the key derivation.

```python,ignore
{{#include ../../../snippets/python/src/nip06.py:keys-from-seed-accounts-pass}}
