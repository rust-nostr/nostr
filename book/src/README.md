## Why rust-nostr?

* **Multi-Language Support**: We support native API's including `Rust`, `Python`, `JavaScript`, `Kotlin` and `Swift` so you can build `nostr` apps in your preferred programming language.

* **Multi-Platform Support**: Write nostr apps for `desktop`, `server`, `mobile`, `web` and/or `embedded` devices!

* **WASM Compatibility**: Most of our libraries compile to `WebAssembly` so that they can be integrated into web applications. 

* **High performance**: Powered by `Rust`'s unparalleled `performance` and `memory safety`, our libraries offers `speed`, `stability` and `reliability`. The same features are extended to its `bindings` in other languages, ensuring optimal stability across diverse development environments.

* **Broad NIP Support**: Support to most relevant `NIPs`. 

* **Customizable**: The libraries are built in modular way, allowing to build customized nostr apps.

## Libraries

* [Nostr](./nostr/01-index.md): Implementation of the `nostr` protocol
* [Nostr Database](): Databases abstraction, indexes and in-memory database implementation
* [Nostr SDK](./nostr-sdk/01-index.md): High level nostr client library

## Communication

It's available a Matrix space with some rooms at [#rustnostr:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#rustnostr:matrix.org).

## State

**These libraries are in ALPHA state**, things that are implemented generally work but the **API will change in breaking ways**.
