# NWC

NWC client and zapper backend for Nostr apps

## State

**This library is in an ALPHA state**, things that are implemented generally work but the API will change in breaking ways.

## Notifications Support

NWC supports real-time payment notifications as specified in NIP-47. 
This allows applications to receive instant updates when payments are sent or received.
See examples/notifications.rs for a simple example of how to use this feature.
